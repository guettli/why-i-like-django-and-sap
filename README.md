# Why I like Django and why I like SAP


Django: A web-framework written in the programming language Python. It is open source

SAP (Netweaver): A technology of the software company SAP SE, and the technical foundation for many SAP applications.

In the following text I use the term "SAP" and mean "SAP Netweaver".

SAP gives me the felling: "do not be afraid of creating new tables", since there already several thousand tables, in SAP.


Django has a really great error-debug-page: You see the stacktrace and all local variables of each frame/line in the stacktrace. That's really great. I would like to see this in SAP: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53595739/pyrfc-sap-get-stacktrace-of-error-not-just-a-message


SELECT ... FROM @itab: I think it very cool that in ABAP you can execute SQL on a tabular variable. You can run a SQL statement on something which is not your database, but just in the memory of the interpreter. Great! https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_itab.htm This allows you to avoid loops and practice "thinking in sets".

I like reading the docs of Python and Django. They are short and clean. And in most cases you understand it immediately.
That's different with the docs of SAP. The are complicated. I do not like to read them (too much text).
Maybe I feel this way because I am familiar with Python and Django. I am new to sap. Maybe it is just a biased feeling. Maybe not.

The built-in data types (list, tuples, dictionaries, sets) are great in Python. The same is possible with abap, but you need more typing: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53613063/dictionaries-in-abap


Unittesting and checking code coverage is daily business in Python and Django projects. In abap this is not that widespread. Maybe I am biased. This is my personal perception.

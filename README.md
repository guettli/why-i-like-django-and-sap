# Why I like Django and why I like SAP


Django: A web-framework written in the programming language Python. It is open source

SAP (Netweaver): A technology of the software company SAP SE, and the technical foundation for many SAP applications.

In the following text I use the term "SAP" and mean "SAP Netweaver".

SAP gives me the felling: "do not be afraid of creating new tables", since there already several thousand tables, in SAP.


Django has a really great error-debug-page: You see the stacktrace and all local variables of each frame/line in the stacktrace. That's really great. I would like to see this in SAP: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53595739/pyrfc-sap-get-stacktrace-of-error-not-just-a-message


SELECT ... FROM @itab: I think it very cool that in ABAP you can execute SQL on a tabular variable. You can run a SQL statement on something which is not your database, but just in the memory of the interpreter. Great! https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_itab.htm

# Why I like Django and why I like SAP


Django: A web-framework written in the programming language Python. It is open source

SAP (Netweaver): A technology of the software company SAP SE, and the technical foundation for many SAP applications.

In the following text I use the term "SAP" and mean "SAP Netweaver".

SAP gives me the felling: "do not be afraid of creating new tables", since there already several thousand tables, in SAP.


Django has a really great error-debug-page: You see the stacktrace and all local variables of each frame/line in the stacktrace. That's really great. I would like to see this in SAP: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53595739/pyrfc-sap-get-stacktrace-of-error-not-just-a-message
